# SEED/Botanic 3D Models
Here you will find our avatar model releases. To begin, we have a male and female model with texture maps. 

### Introduction
Part of the SEED token project. This is a sneak preview - there is more to come.
See [the Wiki](https://github.com/SeedVault/SEEDtoken-IP/wiki) for more information.

### About the SEED Token Project
SEED democratizes AI by offering an open and independent alternative to the monopolies of a few large corporations that currently control conversational user interfaces (CUIs) and AI technologies. SEED's licensed, monetized open-source platform for bots on blockchain supports collaboration and creative compensation that will exceed the proprietary deployments from industry giants. We are also giving users back control of their personal data. Find out more about the SEED Token project at [seedtoken.io](https://seedtoken.io). See the Connect section at the end for contact info.

## MODEL DESCRIPTION

Each model comes with a Maya and OBJ file as well as associated albedo and normal texture maps.
